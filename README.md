# MultiPost 
## Project Description:   
* Social Media platforms play an important role in the success of an organization in terms of marketing and communication with customers, as well as allowing people to share their ideas, feelings, or moments. 
* However, for those who have accounts on multiple social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr or another platform might struggle with managing each social media account due to time and extra effort.    
* Therefore, this application will solve this complexity by integrating the popular Social Media Platforms in one application and allowing users to manage easily through one solution, which is the Multi Post.
